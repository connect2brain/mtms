# An example decider that alternates between different target types, all targeted
# at the same location (x = 0, y = 0, rotation = 0). The target types are as follows:
#
#   - Single pulse with low intensity (20 V/m).
#   - Single pulse with high intensity (30 V/m)
#   - Paired pulse with high intensity followed by low intensity.
#
# A trial with one of the above target types is performed once every two seconds.
#
# Note that if you want to perform trials more frequently, you need to reduce the value
# of MINIMUM_INTERTRIAL_INTERVAL in the environment configuration file (e.g., sites/Aalto/.env
# in the repository root directory) and restart the pipeline (e.g., by running `restart` on the
# command line), as 2.0 seconds is the default minimum intertrial interval for safety reasons.

# The minimum time between the currently processed EEG/EMG samples and the pulse, in seconds. If it is too

# - The time it takes for the EEG device to filter and send the data.
# - The time it takes for the pipeline to preprocess the data (see preprocessor).
# - The time it takes for the decider to make a decision. This is greatly affected by the complexity
#   of the decision-making algorithm.
#
# In practice, 5 ms is a good value to start with when the pipeline does not do any significant processing.

        #    stream.
        #
        # 2) When 'processing_interval_in_samples' is set to 0, the process method is not called periodically at all.

        #
        #   - If the sample window is [0, 0], the buffer will keep only the current sample.

        #   - If the sample window is [-5, -5], the buffer will keep the 5 past samples but will also 'look'
        #     5 samples into the future. In practice, this means that the incoming EEG/EMG samples will be

           - current_time:
               The time of the current sample in seconds.

           - timestamps:
               A list of timestamps for the EEG/EMG samples; a NumPy array of shape (num_of_samples,), where num_of_samples
               is the number of samples in the buffer defined by self.sample_window (e.g, 6 if the sample window is [-5, 0]).

          - valid_samples:
               A list of booleans indicating whether the EEG/EMG samples are valid; a NumPy array of shape (num_of_samples,).
               The validity of the samples is determined on a sample-by-sample basis by the preprocessor of the pipeline.

               The example preprocessor (used as the default) marks all samples as valid, except for one second after
               each pulse.

          - eeg_samples:
               A NumPy array of shape (num_of_eeg_channels, num_of_samples), where num_of_eeg_channels is the number of EEG
               channels and num_of_samples is the number of samples in the buffer defined by self.sample_window.

          - emg_samples:
               A NumPy array of shape (num_of_emg_channels, num_of_samples), where num_of_emg_channels is the number of EMG
               channels and num_of_samples is the number of samples in the buffer defined by self.sample_window.

          - current_sample_index:
               The index of the current sample in the buffer. It always points to the last sample of eeg_samples and
               emg_samples buffers if self.sample_window is set to [-n, 0]. However, if self.sample_window is set,
               e.g., to [-10, 5], current_sample_index would be 10 while the buffers would contain 16 samples.

               Note that this is redundant information, as the current sample can be calculated from self.sample_window,
               but it is provided for convenience.

          - ready_for_trial:
               A boolean indicating whether the pipeline is ready to perform a trial. The pipeline is not ready for a trial
               if the previous trial is still ongoing or if the pipeline is in the process of precomputing the targets.

               For instance, if the pipeline has just started, it will not be ready for a trial until all the targets are
               precomputed, which may take 10-20 seconds for each target.

               Another example is when the decider has decided to perform a trial, say, 0.5 seconds after the current sample.
               During these 0.5 seconds, the pipeline is not ready for another trial, and ready_for_trial will be False.

               The decider should not perform a trial if the pipeline is not ready. However, it can do other processing, such
               as logging, filtering, computing metrics, or training models. If the decider still decides to perform a trial,
               the pipeline will print a warning and ignore the trial.
